Dotfiles
========

This is a collection of dotfiles that I use for customizing OS X to my liking and setting up the software development tools I use on a day-to-day basis. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`. The included Makefile script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/dppascual/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    $ cd ~/dotfiles
    $ make
